# BeltLine Green

BeltLine Green is an interactive data visualization project which uses a custom-designed seesaw as an informational object to allow people to interact with the data about Atlanta BeltLine. "Green", a metaphore for both trees and money, is used as an index for the quality and cost of living. During the construction of BeltLine, people can see notable changes, such as the growth in both home values and the area of green spaces. We use median home value data from Zillow Home Value Index and Trees Atlanta data from 2011 to 2014 to represent the two major changes that BeltLine has brought to the neighborhood nearby. 

We combined physical and spatial interactions to represent what is it feels like to live around the BeltLine. We chose seesaw as the medium of our data visualization, as the playfulness nature of a seesaw can help people with different occupations to communicate with each other and create some meaningful discussions about the BeltLine.
